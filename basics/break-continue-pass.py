"""
The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action.

The break statement,
 it doesn't go further with the loop,breaks out of the innermost enclosing for or while loop.
Loop statements may have an else clause; it is executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion of thiterable (with for) or when the condition becomes false (with while), but not when the loop is terminated by a break statement.

The continue statement, continues with the next iteration of the loop(continue statement skips the current iteration).
