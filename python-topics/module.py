Python Modules
What is a Module?
Consider a module to be the same as a code library.

A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

Create a Module
To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension .py:

Example
Save this code in a file named module.py

"""
def greeting(name):
  print("Hello, " + name)


"""
Variables in Module
The module can contain functions, as already described, but also variables of all types (arrays, dictionaries, objects etc):

Example
Save this code in the file module.py

"""
person1 = {
  "name": "John",
  "age": 36,
  "country": "Norway"
}


"""
Naming a Module
You can name the module file whatever you like, but it must have the file extension .py
